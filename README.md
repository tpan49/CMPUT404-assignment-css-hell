Documentation
=================
The project gutenberg HTML files: 
I deleted all the internal css and used one external styles.css file that I created for three pages. Some internal css were reused or edited in the external files, and I added some more css to satisfy the assignment's requirement.
To be specific on some of the changes:
1. Theme paragraphs with CSS by changing paragraphs' margin, text indent and adding padding
2. Theme header tags with CSS by changing color to dark red, increasing font-size to all headers and change the whole html font-family to "Times New Roman", Times, serif
3. Theme images and images captions with CSS by adding background image - old paper like, and added cover images captions (white text on black background)
4. Change the colour scheme to something aesthetically pleasing by changing text color to green, matched well with the yelllowish background image
